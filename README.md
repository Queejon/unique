# README.md

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Current Development build and source-code can be found at our [Git Repository](https://github.com/Queejon/unique).

## What is this game

This game is the brain-child of a small development team, meant to push the team to learn more about different facets of
programming, all while making a (hopefully) fun game to show for it.

## About the Devs

### General Information

We go by pseudonyms to protect ourselves from any easy intrusions to our privacy, that said, we'd love to hear from you!
You can contact us at queejonjin@gmail.com with any questions, suggestions, or concerns. We are all high school age, to
you adults, but share one thing in common, our passion for creating things. Whether that be programming, writing, music,
art, or any number of things we do, we love to create.

Below is a brief introduction from each of the devs, feel free to read, or don't. It won't hurt our feelings (too much),
but it does mean the world any time someone takes the time to really get to know one of our projects, in any way.

### Queejon

Hey, I go by Queejon, I'm the head Dev of this crazy-ness we call a team. It may be small now, but I have high hopes for
its future, even if that isn't in a formal sense. I have always loved working with computers, and programming quickly
became a natural extension to that passion. While I may not be the most artistic, I do my best to make up for it in solid
logic, both in my programming, and as a person. I also write and compose music, which at some point will hopefully be added
to this project. That said, we have a lot of lofty goals for this, and many other projecets intended to help us learn
different facets of programming and development in general, so it's quite the ways down the road as things currently stand.
That said, I love what I do, and can't wait to make it into a living.
